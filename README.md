# smart-farm-performance-modeling
Performance modeling and analysis of a Smart Farm IoT Irrigation System.

## Project Overview
This repository contains the submission for the Complex Systems Performance Modeling assignment. The project focuses on analyzing the performance of an IoT-based Smart Farm Irrigation System.

## Contents
- `Smart_Farm_Performance_Analysis.docx`: The main report detailing the system, high-level problem, and performance objectives.
- `sample_sensor_dataset.csv`: A generated dataset simulating sensor data from 100 nodes over 24 hours.

## Performance Objectives
The analysis focuses on:
1. Minimizing End-to-End Latency
2. Maximizing System Throughput
3. Maximizing Data Reliability (Minimizing Packet Loss)
4. Optimizing Sensor Battery Life
5. Identifying System Bottlenecks
